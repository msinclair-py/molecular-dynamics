The TCL script bins the z position of each ion at each frame
into the corresponding "slab" (0,1,2). These are then analyzed
in a pandas dataframe to with a pattern-search rolling window
algorithm to identify ions that truly cross through the channel.
This is to ensure that periodicity is accounted for. Currently,
the systems tested on have not had any ion crossings and as a result,
there is no graphical output yet.
