###This script does a grid-wise search of the membrane surface
###(defined by a grid beginning at the z position of phosphorous
###atoms in the phospholipids). The grid adjusts size if it detects
###protein in order to not under-report water concentration.

###This data is processed and then output as a contour map using
###matplotlib
