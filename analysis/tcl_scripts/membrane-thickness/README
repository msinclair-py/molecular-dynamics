#This execute script will call the tcl subscript to determine both
#the net average thickness of a membrane (by phosphorous atoms)
#and a concentric set of rings of user-inputted thickness in angstroms.
#
#This data is then analyzed by python and output into a text file for analysis.
#In an effort to make data analysis easier it may be desired to alter the 
#output string at the end of the python script.
