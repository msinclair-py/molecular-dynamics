The TCL script identifies the number of potassium ions
that are within a 4A cutoff of each residue in the passed
selection. In order to work with a different system, the
VMD selections will need to be evaluated properly (which
ion are you simulation, what resid's would you like to
analyze).

The python script then bins this data and presents it as
a lineplot of relative frequency of ion residence, in a
time-averaged manner. This frequency can exceed 100% as
there could potentially be multiple ions, however this is
unlikely due to electrostatic repulsion.
