Scripts for MD Analysis

Area Compressibility Modulus
This script has two parts, a tcl script for VMD, and a python script
for data analysis. There is a single executable that manages the I/O.

Membrane Thickness
This script evaluates a membrane simulation using a tcl script for VMD.
The resulting data is then analyzed in python and output as a series of
average membrane thickness, for the net membrane average and then the
average of a series of rings surrounded protein of interest of user-defined
length.
