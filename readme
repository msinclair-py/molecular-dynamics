#This package calculates KA, the area compressibility
#modulus of a membrane in a simulation
#
#First, the area of a membrane at various time points in 
#a simulation is calculated in a tcl script whose inputs 
#are a protein structure file, trajectory and the stride 
#of the trajectory.
#
#This data is then averaged and the variance calculated 
#in a python script which is fed into the area compressibility
#modulus formula
